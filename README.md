# Lucile Peltier Archie technical test

I did this test in about 5 hours.

## Challenges

The challenges I encountered where mainly the logic to switch between user in a text thread and to align each element to the correct message and side of the thread.

## Issues

I encountered an issue with KeyboardAwareFlatlist that closed my keyboard instantly so I had to use KeyboardAwareScrollView but it doesn't work perfectly. I would have like to be able to spend more time on it.
The part missing from my technical test is the small curved line between a user and it's booked room. I did not have the time to complete this part.
